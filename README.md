AI Threat Hunting

This repository contains a project focused on developing an AI-based threat hunting system. The system processes network logs, identifies potential security threats, and uses machine learning models to predict and categorize these 
threats.

Project Overview

The AI Threat Hunting project aims to:

Preprocess Data: Clean, normalize, and prepare data for training.
Feature Engineering: Generate useful features from raw data, including time-based features and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Utilize machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, to classify network activities and identify potential threats.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Installation

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Required Python packages (installed via pip)
Steps to Install
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-threat-hunting.git
cd ai-threat-hunting
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Generating Synthetic Data
If you need to generate synthetic data for testing, you can run:

bash
Copy code
python generate_logs.py
This will create synthetic network logs and save them in the data/logs/ directory.

Preprocessing the Data
Before training the model, you need to preprocess the data:

bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py
This script will clean the data, handle missing values, and save the processed data in the data/processed/ directory.

Model Training
To train the machine learning model, run:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This script will:

Load the processed data.
Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.
Train a LightGBM model with hyperparameter tuning.
Save the trained model to the models/ directory.
Evaluation

After training, the model's performance will be evaluated, and the following metrics will be printed:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made.
Recall: Correct positive predictions out of all actual positives.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
ROC AUC: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
A confusion matrix will also be displayed, showing the distribution of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
